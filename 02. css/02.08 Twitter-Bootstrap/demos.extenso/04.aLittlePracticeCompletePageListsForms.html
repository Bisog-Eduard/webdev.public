            A <strong>comic book</strong> is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. <br>
           Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. 
          </p>
          <p>Look on wikipedia :</p>
          <blockquote>
           Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s.[clarification needed] The first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.[2] The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.<br>
